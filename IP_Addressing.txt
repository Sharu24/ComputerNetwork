Classfull IP Addressing

An IP Address in a information about how to reach a 
specific machine over computer networks - especially 
if they are outside LAN.

An IP address is a 32 bit unique address having 
an address space of 2^32.

Example:
    10000000 01100110 00001110 00001001
    128.102.14.9 (decimal)
    80.66.0E.09 (Hex)

Validations
    allowed per octet- 0 to 255 (0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255)
    No zeros prefixed - 025 is invalid

ClassFull Addressing
    Class A
    Class B
    Class C
    Class D - Multicast
    Class E - Experimental

    Order of bits in the First Octet determines the Class
    
    IPv4 has two parts
        Network ID - id, how many networks
        Host ID - id, how many devices connected to it
    
    Each IST or network provider assigns IP address to 
    each device thats connected to its network

    While counting no. of hosts 2 bits are not counted
        1st IP address is the NEtwork Number
        last IP Address is used for broadcast purposes
    
Class A 
    Large number of Hosts
    Network ID is 8 bits long
    Host ID is 24 bits long

    highest order bit = 0
    no of networks = 2^7-2 = 128-2 = 126 network ID's
    no of hosts = 2^24-2 = 16,777,214 host ID's

    1.x.x.x -> 126.x.x.x

Class B
    Medium to Intermediate no. of Hosts
    Network ID is 16 bits long
    Host ID is 8 Bit long

    highest order bit = 10
    no of networks = 2^14 = 16384 networks
    no of hosts = 2^16-2 = 65534 hosts

    128.0.x.x -> 191.255.x.x

Class C
    Small Sized Networks
    Network ID is 24 bits long
    Host Id is 8  bits long

    Highest order bit = 110

    192.0.0.x -> 223.255.255.x

Class D
    reserved for Multicast
    
    Highest order bit = 1110
    remaining 28 bits are for host id

    224.0.0.0 -> 239.255.255.255.255

Class E
    reserved for experimental and research purposes
    
    highest order bit = 1111

    240.0.0.0 -> 255.255.255.254


Range of special IP addresses:

169.254.0.0 – 169.254.0.16 : Link local addresses
127.0.0.0 – 127.0.0.8 : Loop-back addresses
0.0.0.0 – 0.0.0.8 : used to communicate within the current network.
